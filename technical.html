          <h1>Auto Loan Options & Approval Likelihood Calculator</h1>
          <p>A full stack program that provides users the opportunity to calculate auto loan options and approval likelihood based on their financial information. This is a CSC207 group course project with collaboration with Senso.AI, our industry partner.</p>

          <h1>Relationship between Money & Climate Change - Python</h1>
          <p>In relation to the income classifications, what is the relationship between the revenue generated by different sectors in countries worldwide and their contributions to greenhouse gas emissions? This technical project uses Python as well as pandas and plotly libraries to explore this question. This project is a collaborative work with Komal Saini as part of CSC110 Final Project.</p>

          <h1>Picturing the Power of Policy in a Pandemic - Python</h1>
          <p>In this project, we are interested in analyzing the efficacy of various global policy responses in reducing deaths and cases. In doing so, we hope to learn more about the interconnections between policies and their role in reducing transmission of COVID-19, and shed light on the policy response(s) that have been most effective in their respective regions. This project uses Python as well as libraries like plotly, networkx and pandas. This project is a collaborative work with Komal Saini as part of CSC111 Final Project, where we have to use graphs and graphs algorithm to represent our data.</p>

          <h1>First Simple Unity Game - C#</h1>
          <p>In this project, I explore Unity game physics, mechanisms as well as its C# scripting API by creating a simple unity game. In the github repo, you may find the link to the game (the password is also given in the repo).</p>

          <h1>Vaxman - Python</h1>
          <p>Vaxman is a slightly modified version of the game "Pacman", where vaxman can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (but does not kill vaxman). Each ghost that has not been killed multiplies itself every 30 seconds, and the goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number. This project is made using Python and pygame library.</p>

          <h1>Unity Junior Programmer Learning Pathway Code</h1>
          <p>These two repositorise contain code that I have written as I was completing the 4 learning pathways for Unity Junior Programmer. All the codes are written by myself either for the assignments in the learning pathways, or for the follow-along coding sessions. Refer to the repositoties to see which skills (such as object oriented programming in C# for Unity games) are covered.</p>
