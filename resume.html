                      <p class="description">Innovation has always been a key driver of economic growth, population health, and societal success. Transformative change has historically been linked to major innovations such as urban sanitation, pasteurization, the printing press and the industrial revolution. Currently, the opportunity to enhance life chances worldwide relies on innovating for the poor, social innovation, and the ability to harness scientific and technological knowledge. What precisely is innovation? When does innovation happen? Who benefits from innovation? How can innovation be fostered, and how do innovations spread? Relying on major global transformations and country-specific case studies (for example, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel and India), this course examines the drivers of innovation, the political, social, economic, and scientific and technological factors that are critical to promoting innovation and addressing current global challenges, and the consequences of innovation.</p>

                      <p class="description">Governing public goods has been an age-old concern for social scientists and policymakers alike. This is not surprising since the provision of global public goods is riddled by problems of collective action. In this course, we focus on how to implement solutions through states, markets and communities.

                        The first objective is to familiarize students with the concept of global public goods, the different mechanisms that can provide these goods and the challenges that emerge from lacking incentives to secure their provision. To this end, the course will introduce theories from sociology, political science, philosophy, and history to help us understand different types of governance mechanisms and how they may be used to scale global solutions. Theories can help us explain the tensions between cooperating for the public good at the expense of sacrificing individual goals, or why certain areas of our lives, like the Internet, seem to produce public goods without any formal mechanism of cooperation.
                        
                        The second objective is to use the class and subject of study as an arena to model and practice the kind of learning that is expected of university students. The main skills that the course will help students target and develop are: research (finding, evaluating and assimilating reliable information); writing (developing ideas into logically written arguments); and critical analysis of arguments presented in the readings and debated in class (this includes identifying the key assumptions that are implicit in different theories as well as inherent in our own positions on various questions related to governance).</p>

                      <summary>MUN105 - Global Problem-Solving: Laboratory Opportunities</summary>
                      <p class="description">This course teaches students how to conduct analytically rigorous social science research to improve their insights into complex global problems and devise innovative solutions to address them. A unique feature of this class is that students have the opportunity to learn by doing. Students work hands-on in one of several labs dealing with some of the most intractable global problems of our time in the areas of the environment, health, digital governance, security and the gap between rich and poor. By the end of this course students will be able to:

                        (1) Experience and practice the process of social science research,
                        (2) Narrow the scope of a complex global challenge into a manageable research problem that can be tackled over the course of the semester, 
                        (3) Improve their knowledge and insights on a particular global problem, 
                        (4) Develop a viable, compelling and implementable solution that can help address an aspect of a global problem, 
                        (5) Pitch a solution in a compelling way to a jury of experts in global affairs.
                        Students will work with their peers in small seminar classes and lab group settings, mentored by graduate teaching assistants specializing in global affairs, expert faculty and senior policy advisors dedicated to addressing global issues in the fields of the environment, health, security, digital governance and political economy. </p>
